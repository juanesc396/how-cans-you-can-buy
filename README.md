# how-cans-you-can-buy
This project ask the question of how many cans you can buy with 1000 ARS(Argentinian Currency) in the rest of the world.

For it, I have scraped grocery shops in several cities around the world. Then I have created a DataFrame and ploted the data recolected in a Bar Chart.

In this project, I used Python libraries like Requests, BeautifulSoup, Xmls for scrape and parse. And Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn to make the plot.
